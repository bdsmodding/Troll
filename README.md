## Usage

- Automatic:

    Just run Troll.py and enjoy.

    ```log
    usage: Troll.py [-h] [-e EXT_SYMBOL_LIST] [-d WORK_DIR]

    Troll script

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -e EXT_SYMBOL_LIST, --ext-symbol-list EXT_SYMBOL_LIST
                            External symbol list file path
    -d WORK_DIR, --work-dir WORK_DIR
                            Work directory
    ```

- Manual:

    ```cmd
    Troll.exe <build_directory> <include_header_file> <pe_file_path> <pdb_export_path> <pdb_name> [external_symbol_list]
    ```

    The last argument is optional, and it is a file of external symbols that you want to dump. The list should be separated by a newline.

    Maybe you can dump external symbols from a old version of the game.
